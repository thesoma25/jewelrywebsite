# Product and Cart Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the product page and cart functionality for the Marquise Maison e-commerce website, addressing the issue where products were not being added to the cart and the subtotal was not working properly.

## Files Modified/Created

1. **single-product.html**
   - Added product.js script
   - Added product-custom.css stylesheet

2. **New JavaScript Files**:
   - **js/product.js**: Handles product interactions and add to cart functionality

3. **New CSS Files**:
   - **css/product-custom.css**: Styles for product page elements and add to cart message

4. **Utility Scripts**:
   - **open_product.ps1**: PowerShell script to open single-product.html in browser

## Functionality

### 1. Product Page (single-product.html)

- Users can adjust product quantities using the plus/minus buttons
- Users can select product variations (length, finish)
- "Add to Cart" button adds the product to the cart stored in localStorage
- Success message appears when a product is added to the cart

### 2. Cart Storage

- Cart data is stored in localStorage for persistence
- If the same product (with same variations) is added again, quantity is updated
- Cart data includes product name, price, quantity, image, and variations

### 3. Cart Page Integration

- The existing cart.js handles cart operations and checkout process initiation
- Cart totals (subtotal, shipping, total) are calculated correctly
- Cart data is saved to sessionStorage before proceeding to checkout

## Technical Implementation

### Add to Cart Process

1. User selects product variations and quantity
2. User clicks "Add to Cart" button
3. Product details are collected and stored in localStorage
4. Success message is displayed with a link to the cart page

### Cart Data Structure

```javascript
// Example cart item structure
{
    name: "Gold Chain",
    price: "$200.00",
    quantity: 2,
    image: "images/product-item4.jpg",
    variations: {
        length: "18 inches",
        finish: "Gold"
    }
}
```

## How to Test

1. Open single-product.html using the PowerShell script:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File open_product.ps1
   ```

2. Select product variations and quantity, then click "Add to Cart"

3. Observe the success message

4. Navigate to the cart page to see the added product

3. Add product reviews submission functionality
4. Implement product recommendations based on cart items
5. Add product quick view functionality from product listings
