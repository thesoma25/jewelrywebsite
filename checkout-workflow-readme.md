# Checkout Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of the complete checkout workflow for the Marquise Maison e-commerce website, from adding products to cart through payment processing and displaying a thank you message upon successful purchase.

## Files Modified/Created

1. **checkout.html**
   - Added form validation attributes
   - Linked to checkout.js script
   - Added custom CSS for checkout process

2. **cart.html**
   - Linked to cart.js script for cart functionality

3. **New JavaScript Files**:
   - **js/cart.js**: Handles cart operations (add, remove, update quantities)
   - **js/checkout.js**: Manages checkout process, form validation, and payment processing

4. **New CSS Files**:
   - **css/checkout-custom.css**: Styles for checkout process, payment overlay, and thank you message

5. **Utility Scripts**:
   - **open_cart.ps1**: PowerShell script to open cart.html in browser
   - **open_checkout.ps1**: PowerShell script to open checkout.html in browser

## Workflow

### 1. Shopping Cart (cart.html)

- Users can adjust product quantities
- Cart totals update automatically
- "Proceed to Checkout" button saves cart data to browser session storage
- Cart data persists between pages

### 2. Checkout (checkout.html)

- Form with billing/shipping details
- Order summary shows items from cart
- Payment method selection
- Form validation ensures all required fields are completed

### 3. Payment Processing

- Clicking "Place Order" validates the form
- Shows payment processing overlay
- Simulates payment processing (2-second delay)

### 4. Thank You Message

- After successful payment, displays a thank you message
- Shows order confirmation
- Provides a "Continue Shopping" button to return to homepage

## How to Test

1. Open cart.html using the PowerShell script:
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File open_cart.ps1
   ```

2. Adjust quantities, then click "Proceed to Checkout"

3. Fill in the checkout form and click "Place Order"

4. Observe the payment processing overlay and then the thank you message

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. Cart data is stored in browser's sessionStorage
2. Checkout page loads this data to display order summary
3. Form submission triggers payment processing
4. Success message is displayed after payment completion

### Form Validation

- Client-side validation ensures all required fields are filled
- Visual feedback with red/green indicators for invalid/valid fields

### Payment Processing

- Currently simulated with a timeout
- In a production environment, would connect to a payment gateway API

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement actual payment gateway integration
2. Add order tracking functionality
3. Send confirmation emails
4. Store orders in a database
5. Add user accounts for order history
